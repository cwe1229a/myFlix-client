# myFlix-client
React app for client-side view of MyFlix/Movie api
 I've chosen to go with pirate themed movies , because pirates are cool üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
 ## Purpose
 This project is being used to understand and learn how to navigate React and work further on the MERN stack when it comes to creating applications. This is a continuation of my movie_api repository. I'll be using Parcel as well for my build tool.
